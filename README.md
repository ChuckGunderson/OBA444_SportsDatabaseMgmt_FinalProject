## Operational Database
I first developed my Relational Database for a hockey league in dbdiagram.io then exported it to a “MySQL” file. Where I then used an LLM to convert the MySQL code into SQLlite which could be read with https://orpinots.github.io/sql-sandbox/ to visualize the diagram and construct queries. The Dataset contains 9 entities; Stadium, Team, Player, Coach, Management, Contract, Game, Season, and PlayerGameStats. The schema is normalized to a level of 3NF, but is essentially in BCNF. In my schema every determinant is either a primary key or a foreign key pointing to a primary key, with only slight exceptions. In Season, ‘Year’ could theoretically be unique but it’s not declared unique. In Stadium, ‘StadiumName’ could be unique, but it’s not declared as such. While BCNF does not require those to be declared unique; it requires no functional dependency violations, which my schema does not have.
See files begining with OD_x for insert functions and querries for SQLlite.

## Star Schema Database
Following the intial process as the Operational Database, taking current tables and values and extrapolating into Facts and Dimension tables. This database models a hockey league with 1 Fact table and 4 Dimension tables. The Team table stores organizational and financial information; both Player and Coach reference Team, creating one-to-many relationships. The Game table links two teams (home and away) with attendance and revenue fields. The PlayerGameStats table forms a many-to-many bridge between Player and Game, storing individual performance metrics for each matchup. The schema is normalized to 3NF, tables use valid primary keys, attributes depend only on those keys, and no transitive dependencies remain.
